# Username generator

Create a web application that generates random usernames for players by combining a user-provided prefix with a random suffix (from suffix.js).

- Users enter a prefix in the input field.
- Users click the generate button to create a random username.
- The generated username is displayed, combining the user's prefix with a random suffix from the list.
- Users can click a button to copy the generated username to the clipboard.

**Example**

- The user enters "Cool" as the prefix.
- The user clicks the "Generate Username" button.
- The username "CoolDragon" is displayed with a smooth scaling animation.
- The user clicks the "Copy to Clipboard" button, and an alert confirms that the username has been copied.
