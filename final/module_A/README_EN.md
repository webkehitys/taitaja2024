# Module A - Design, Customer Work, and Project Management

**Competition time for the task: 2 hours**

In this module, you will prepare an estimation and design documentation for the webpage. At the beginning of the module, the customer will introduce their company, website, and vision. You can take notes on paper and ask questions if necessary.

## Planning

You are tasked with designing wireframes for a High Score Hall of Fame gallery website for Retro Game House. This includes creating wireframes for both the landing page and the game page, optimised for both mobile and desktop versions (a total of four wireframes). The wireframes can be simple and contain only placeholders. You do not need to add actual content. The most important thing is to show how the elements, features, and page layout are designed.

- Desktop version: 1440px wide
- Mobile version: 375px wide

Create a new website structure that is intuitive and user-friendly, meeting the customer's needs. Focus primarily on visually, interestingly, and clearly presenting the games and their scores. When drafting the wireframes, use the description of the next module to understand the technical requirements and incorporate them into the design to get a clear idea of the final product.

The website wireframes should be produced digitally. The wireframes must be in PNG or JPG format and not screenshots of web pages. This means that coding in this module is not allowed.

## Project scope document

Prepare a project scope document for the client, showing how you will highlight the uniqueness of the retro game museum in your plans. The proposal should be in .pdf format, added to the final task's GitHub repository, and include your created wireframes. Additionally, the document should contain estimates for the web application's price, the resources needed, and a timetable. Name the file as follows: `project_scope_firstname_lastname.pdf`.

## Project management

In addition, this module involves creating the technical conditions to carry out the task according to the instructions. You need to set up a GitHub repository under the Taitaja2024 organisation and create a README file where you will gather all necessary project information. Ensure that you follow good practices for the README file and commit messages.

**At the end of the module, you must deliver:**

- A GitHub repository with an initial `README.md` file.
- Digital wireframes - desktop and mobile versions (in the GH repository, in the `assets/wireframes` folder).
- A project scope document (in the GH repository, in the `assets/wireframes` folder).
